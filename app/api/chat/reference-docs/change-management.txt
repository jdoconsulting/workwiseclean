      CHANGE MANAGEMENT
"The central issue (regarding change) is never strategy, structure, culture, or systems. The core of the matter is always about changing the behavior of people.”

APPLICATION TECHNIQUE:
Make the most out of the time you spent on this course by applying the changes you identified as
necessary to unlearn habits and skills that have outlived their usefulness and to become a more
effective version of you.
START HERE:
[Sample: I want to become more vocal when I feel that the team is going in the wrong direction. ]
Confirm you have the right change identified by repeating the following set of questions until you
1) have confirmed this change is the right one
2) you have modified the original change or
3) you have determined the change is not the right one.
Tips: Apply the answer from the previous question to next question each time.
To get the most out of this exercise, ask the questions a minimum of 3 times.
Write in the change you have identified:
To become more vocal.
Why do you want this change?
What does it give you?
The people that are most vocal cause us to go off track
with projects, processes, etc. If I were more vocal, then I
could minimize the derailment. This would give me a
better sense of control.
And why do you want that?
What does that give you?
Having a better sense of control would help me be less
frustrated with the team (rework, missed deadlines,
letting down the customer, working longer hours than
necessary)
And why do you want that?
What does that give you?
More control and less frustration would allow me to
contribute to the solution rather than get stuck in ‘how
things are’. Contributing to the solution would help me
feel more valuable.
And why do you want that?
What does that give you?
When I feel valuable, I am energized, and eager to make a
difference. When I want to make a difference, I am less
resigned to the way things have always been, this gives
me hope.
And why do you want that?
What does that give you?
When I have hope, I can better share my knowledge,
insights, and thoughts about a situation. This can help me
be more confident in being vocal.
The final response above is your clarified WHY. Refine the statement in this space and carry it over
to the next page.
Today, I do not have enough hope that I can make a difference or that things can be better. Today, I
don’t speak up when I clearly see the team is off track.
By not speaking up, I am contributing to the problem, not to the solution.

APPLICATION TECHNIQUE:
Change Management Methodology applied to personal change
WHY: (Current State)
Carry over your response from above.
Today, I do not have enough hope that I can make a difference or that things can
be better. Today, I don’t speak up when I clearly see the team is off track.
By not speaking up, I am contributing to the problem, not to the solution.
VISION: (Future State)
What does the vision look like? Feel like? Be specific. Paint a vivid picture.
When I am hopeful, I do not wait to be asked for or hesitate to share my concerns,
knowledge, and thoughts when the team is going off track. My vocalization
encourages others to also be vocal, and together we make better decisions.
We increase profits by reducing unnecessary hours, rework and turnover. Work
becomes more energizing than draining. Meetings are more inclusive and produce
greater results.
COMMUNICATION:
How will you share the vision so that others see it too?
What ways can you consistently communicate the ideal outcome?
I can share the vision by discussing this with others – so that more can become
hopeful and become part of the change. I can communicate the vision by developing
a routine of asking others how work would be different when we all have more hope
and can vocalize our knowledge, concerns, and thoughts at critical points.
SAMPLE 12 Month Plan
BARRIERS:
What could prevent you from realizing the vision?
What could possibly get in your way?
What can you do to minimize or remove each identified barrier?
Barrier Actions to minimize/remove barrier
Barrier 1:
Fear of being shut down publicly.
1. Increase my understanding of the real
consequences of speaking up.
a. Weighing the current short-term gain
of protecting myself from public
shutdown to the long-term results of
vocalizing and making a difference.
b. Considering how to handle the worst-
case scenario
c. Consider how to handle the best-case
scenario
d. Proactively connect with others to
build support for each other to
vocalize.
Barrier 2:
Not being prepared for the
situation when it arises.
1. Gather information ahead of meetings
2. Outline my thoughts/ideas/etc. on hot
topics so that I am prepared to share
at any time the subject or situation
comes up.
METRICS: (leading indicators)
How will you know we are getting closer to realizing the common vision? & How will you know
the barriers are being reduced?
Metric: (leading) – Actions taken to increase my understanding of true
consequences for a period of time– (how often did I complete 1a – d )
Metric: (leading) – Actions taken to prepare for meetings/discussions for a period
of time (Barrier 2)
Metric: (Lagging)
The number of times that I speak up when at a critical point in a
meeting/situation. The frequency today vs in 3 months, 6 months, 9months, 12
months.
Metric: (Lagging)
The amount of support I receive from others when vocalizing – Today vs n 3
months, 6 months, 9months, 12 months. (Support in this case is defined by
frequency of encouragement to continue, engagement in conversation, others
adding their voice, etc.)
SAMPLE 12 Month Plan
REINFORCEMENT:
How will you ensure the vision holds up? (think BELT)
Behaviors The behaviors from the program that I would need to
demonstrate in order to sustain the ‘future state’ or
realized vision – would be –
Direct Communication – speaking up/stating what
needs to be said
Powerful Questioning – Asking questions that
provoke thought and discussion to generate more
data
Presence - focusing on where I am at the moment,
limiting distractions, giving 100% rather than
multitasking
Environment
It would be necessary to prep the environment (my
desk, video conference calls, emails, teams sites,
etc.) with reminders to speak up and what it could be
like if we all spoke up – (less hours, more profit, etc.)
Language
Intentionally using words that convey the vision, even
in times of great frustration, i.e. ‘What if…’,
‘Imagine…’, … and words that invite others to add to
the process, i.e. ‘X, what are your thoughts?’, ‘Y, how
have you addressed this in the past?’
Thoughts Identify the head chatter and change the script to
support the vision.
Thoughts would include ‘we are on a journey’,
‘silence is acceptance’, ‘I can do this’, ‘We can do
this’, etc. Catch negative or unproductive head
chatter and switch to a supportive voice.
